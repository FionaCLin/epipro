# Management Information
[//]: # (D1, D4)

## Member Responsibilities

The team roles was be designated as follows:
*	Ines Sarmiento – Project Manager, Product Owner, Front-end Developer
*	Fiona Lin – Scrum Master, Developer, Devops
*	Shenghan Gao – Back-end Developer, Development Tester
*	Yuexuan Liu – Back-end Developer, Development Tester

## Work	arrangements

The project was conducted using the agile methodology. The start and end of each sprint checkpoint correlated to each of the four submission deadline checkpoints. This ensured that there was a working iteration of the project by each deadline date.

During the implementation stage of the API and the main application, the members mainly focussed within the following areas:

*	Ines Sarmiento – front-end development

Based on the end user background and characteristic, developed user interface for our application and helped achieve our user experience goals. Futhermore, they helped develop tests for relevant system components.

*	Shenghan Gao – back-end development

Focused on retriving news and articles from the WHO data source, and helped provide sophisicated algorithms to extract information and compose the disease report into the designated json format. Also helped develop comprehensive unit tests for the corresponding system components.

*	Yuexuan Liu – back-end development

Was mainly in charge of API design and implementation as well as disease reports data storage in mLab. Also helped develop comprehensive unit tests for each API module.

*	Fiona Lin – full-stack development

Was in charge of ensuring the streamline workflow of system development life cycle and system features, alongside frequently fixing and updating the deployment. Collaboratively worked with all members for continuous deployment.

During development, we expected team members to be proactive and to fulfil their associated tasks before the deadline, as well as assist and collaborate with each other to achieve the perfect completion of each deliverable. Additionally, all members were required to write up design, documentation and workflow manual for their related system components. Members were allowed to work outside of their areas, if they already fulfilled their tasks early in the sprint or if a task of higher-priority came up.


## Team coordination and communication

Our agile workflow involved weekly stand-up meetings, where we identified what tasks have been completed, what tasks were still in progress, and any obstacles which prevented us from completing our tasks. This was further facilitated online by the project management application, **Trello** [(our Trello board)](https://trello.com/b/qjgAoQrL/seng3011). Trello allowed the team to observe our work flow and progress within the current sprint. It helped uphold a level of accountability for the timely completion of our tasks.

Version control within our project was provided through **Github** and **Git**. This enabled members to work individually on their given tasks through branching, whilst an up-to-date version was available for be merging between team members.

We also used **Slack** as our online communication channel of our current progress. Slack allowed the creation of conversation channels for specific members, such as the back-end and front-end development groups. Our Slack was also setup to connect to Github, where the channels were notified of multiple Github events, such as pull requests, CI system and so on.
