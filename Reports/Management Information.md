## Work	arrangements

The project will be conducted using the agile methodology. The start and end of each sprint checkpoint will correlate to each of the four submission deadline checkpoints. This will ensure that there is a working iteration of the project by each deadline date.

During the implementation stage of the API and the main application, the members will focus mainly in the following areas:

Team members will be proactive and fulfil their associated tasks before the deadline, as well as assist and collaborate with each other to achieve the perfect completetion of each deliverable. Additionally, all members are required to write up design, documentation and workflow manual for the related system components. Members may also work outside of their areas, if they have fulfilled their tasks early in the sprint or if a task of higher-priority arises.


## Team coordination and communication

Our agile workflow will involve weekly stand-up meetings where we identify what tasks have been completed, what tasks are still in progress, and any obstacles which prevent us from completing our tasks. This will further be facilitated online by the project management application, **Trello** [(our Trello board)](https://trello.com/b/qjgAoQrL/seng3011). Trello will allow the team to observe our work flow and progress within the current sprint. It helps upheld a level of accountability for completing our tasks on time.

Version control within our project will be provided be **Github** and **Git**. This will enable members to work individually on our given tasks through branching, whilst an up-to-date version can be merged into between team members.

We will also use **Slack** as our online communication channel of our current progress. Slack allows the creation of conversation channels for specific members, such as the back-end and front-end development groups. Slack can also be setup to connect to Github, where the channels can be notified of multiple Github events, such as pull requests, CI system and so on.
