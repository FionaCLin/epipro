### Responsibilities and organization of the team
The project will be conducted using the agile methodology. The start and end of each sprint checkpoint will correlate to each of the four submission deadline checkpoints. This will ensure that there is a working iteration of the project by each deadline date.
#### Gantt Chart for progression of project

During the implementation stage of the API and the main application, the members will focus mainly in the following areas. The team roles will be designated as follows:

*	Ines Sarmiento –  Project Manager, Product Owner, Front-end Developer

Based on the end user background and characteristic, develops user interface for our application and achieve our user experience goals. Futhermore, develope tests for relevant system components.

*	Fiona Lin – Scrum Master, Full-Stack Developer, Devops

In charge of ensuring the streamline workflow of system development life cycle and system features, fixes and updates deployment frequently. Also collaboratively works with all members for continuous deployment.

*	Shenghan Gao – Back-end Developer, Development Tester

Focuses on retriving news and articles from the WHO data source, and provides a sophisicated algorithms to extract information and compose the disease report into the designated json format. Additionally, helps develop comprehensive unit tests for the corresponding system components.

*	Yuexuan Liu – Back-end Developer, Development Tester

Mainly in charge of API design and implementation as well as disease reports data storage in mLab. Additionally, develops comprehensive unit tests for each API module.
### Project Review
 [//]: # (- How did the project go in your opinion ?  - Major achievements in project)
 #### Overall Major achievements
 In our opinions, we believe we do our best for this project to achieve our propject goals and aims.

 For each deliverable, we are not only finished before the deadline but also put extra effort on achieving those extra features our platform proposed.  

We always attemp to colaborate with all stakeholders and understand all their needs to provide the desired features instead of whatever the developers believe. Therefore, we acquired our major achievements as listed below:

*  Scrape our data source WHO and extra information to form the required disease reports successfully
* Store preprocessed disease reports into mongodb database successfully
* Develope and deploy REST API endpoints to query disease report for medical professionals further analysis successfully
* Develope and deploy User Friendly Web Application to visualise our disease reports and media coverages statistics graphically

 #### Challenges
 During the developement, some components have been underestimated. Therefore, that become some challenges in regarding to time management also problem solving.

 For example, the most challenge would be the web scraping of data source WHO. There are a lot of problem with the raw data. 
 
 Firstly, we need to learn the web scraping tool and the most common and professional way to scrape the data source right. And then, we need to analyse the variation of data format from different years and then normalised and unify those raw data. This part has been underestimated from beginning as we did not see the amount and inconsistency of raw data from day one. Moveover, the locations identification is also a problem as we don't have any location data in database. 

 However, with great team effort and engineering skills, we are able to manage to solving these problems in a novel way and meet each deadline.

 Another challenge would be the limitations on the licencing of Twitter/Google news APIs. Twitter APIs and Google news APIs are options for our project. As Twitter APIs has its licence fee, and some of the APIs are not available untill we pay for it. Since that is an issue related to budgetting and management level decision, we have decised use both to increase the social media coverage and cover what are not available from Twitter as our workaround solution.

 Another common challenge would be the team workflow. As forming the team in this short period, there are lots of collision in code format editing. We spot and address that issue among team members and agree with the common setting for our development.

 #### Further Improvements
 In general, our team is a great combination of different strengths and skills, which makes our team project goes well.

 Chris and Han have their strength in backend server.
 
 Ines has her strength in UX design and frontend UI. 
 
 Fiona has the experiences in full stack development and deployment.

 Hence, we wish we had those strength and skills of other team members before the workshop.
